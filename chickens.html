      <h1>Chickens</h1>
      The <b>chicken (Gallus gallus domesticus)</b> is a large and round
      short-winged bird, domesticated from the red junglefowl of Southeast Asia
      around 8,000 years ago. Most chickens are raised for food, providing meat
      and eggs; others are kept as pets or for cockfighting.
